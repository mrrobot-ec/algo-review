# Algorithms and Data Structures in GO ðŸš€

## What?

This repo is related to the book Introduction to Algorithms written by (Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald Rivest, Clifford Stein) and it's purpose is to review algorithms in golang based on the excercises and theory from the book.

## Why?

Because of the following reasons:

- I've been always in love with competitive programming so I will practice who knows maybe one day I compete.
- As a software engineer I had used a variaty of technologies but when I first use go
  I don't want to look back and I want to make golang my main language.

## How?

I'll try to read and implement hopefully everyday till finish the book.
